# Project Guide

## Contributing

We'd love your contributions to the project, especially fixes to long-standing issues. To increase the chance of PRs being merged, please create
an issue to discuss any work you plan to do that you'd like to share upstream beforehand. This will allow us to provide feedback on the direction and avoid
stepping on each others toes!

You can also contribute by submitting bugs as issues or any feedback at all to our discussion forum. Tell us how you'd *like* to use Treehouse if you find
that you can't. 

## Roadmap

We're still formalizing our roadmap, how to organize it, share it, and collaborate with the community on it. For now, keep an eye on the
GitHub issues and discussions.
