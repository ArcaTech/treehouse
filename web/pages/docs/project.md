# Project Guide

## Contributing

We'd love your contributions to the project, especially fixes to long-standing issues. If you'd like to work on something that necessitates discussion first, please create an issue so we can provide feedback and avoid stepping on each other's toes.

You can also contribute by:
* submitting bugs as [issues](https://github.com/treehousedev/treehouse/issues)
* sharing feedback on our [discussion forum](https://discord.gg/6Ae3VNqJbr)

We welcome any kind of feedback about features you'd like, and we'd especially love to learn about your use case.

## Roadmap

We're still formalizing our roadmap, how to organize it, share it, and collaborate with the community on it. For now, keep an eye on the [GitHub issues](https://github.com/treehousedev/treehouse/issues) and [discussions](https://discord.gg/6Ae3VNqJbr).
