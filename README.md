## Demo

This project is meant as a frontend toolkit for your own note-taking app,
but we're maintaining a usable [live demo](https://treehouse.sh/demo/) 
based on the current state of the main branch.

## Development

Contribute by [installing Deno](https://deno.land/manual@v1.30.0/getting_started/installation), 
cloning the repo, and running:

```
deno task serve
```

This will run a development server for the project site that includes the
demo, which you can use for development.
